    <p class="aboutCroix">St Croix Valley Regional Tourism Alliance Interactive Map
       is a full-stack web application that complements the St Croix Valley Regional Tourism Alliance's
       existing website and printed visitor guide. The map allows users to view featured places by category
       (Dining, Shopping, Nature, Lodging) or view suggested trips including driving directions from the
       user's current location.  Administrator privileges allow the staff at St Croix Valley Regional Tourism Alliance to add,
       edit or delete featured places on the map. Administrator can also add, edit or delete suggested trips with name,
       trip description and trip stops selected from featured places. Administrator can also add, edit or delete other administrators.
       This administrator functionality provides the Alliance to update information easily and more frequently; their print publication
       is produced once/year. The website does not offer a dynamic or interactive user experience in planning a trip.  This app was built using
       the following languages: Express, AngularJS, Node.js, PostgreSQL, Firebase authentication, Bootstrap, Bootstrap UI, ng-map, Google Maps API, Google Places API.<br>
