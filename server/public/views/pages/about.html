    <p class="aboutTag">When I was 19 years old, I decided to embark on a trip to Central America. I had traveled before but only in North America and the Caribbean. I went fourth with this idea and enrolled into a Spanish immersion school located in Antigua, Guatemala.
      I always felt like I had a passion for langauges but had never really gave it a full effort. I ended up staying at this immersion school for about 7 months, and then continuing with my travels knowing that the langauge barrier that once existed,
      was now gone. I ended up traveling through several countries like Mexico, Colombia, Dominican Republic and lived in Brazil for 10 months. Now, I speak both Spanish and Portuguese at a near fluent level. After this, I ended up going home because
      I knew I did not want to teach English nor bartend for the rest of my life. So I started thinking of what I could do for a living. Knowing how much I love languages, I came across Developing. Took some free online classes and really started to like
      it. It was very similar to learning another language, instead it is not spoken. After taking a couple classes I enrolled in a Full Stack Development boot camp in Minneapolis and started learning to develop the same way I learned Spanish.. Intesively.
      I have now graduated from Prime Digital Academy with a certificate in Full Stack Software Engineering.
